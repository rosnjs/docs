# Authentication

To access the NPAY Payment Gateway API, you'll need to authenticate using your API credentials. The API uses OAuth2-style authentication with access tokens.

## Getting Your API Credentials

Before you can make API calls, you need to obtain your API credentials from your NPAY merchant account:

1. **Log in** to your NPAY merchant dashboard
2. **Navigate** to the API section
3. **Collect** your **Client ID** (Primary Key) and **Secret Key**
4. **Keep them secure** - these credentials are sensitive

<Warning>
  Keep your API credentials confidential and never share them publicly. Store them securely in environment variables or secure configuration files.
</Warning>

## Authentication Flow

The NPAY API uses a two-step authentication process:

1. **Get Access Token** - Use your Client ID and Secret Key to obtain an access token
2. **Use Access Token** - Include the access token in subsequent API requests

## Access Token

The access token is a temporary credential that allows you to make authenticated API requests. It has the following characteristics:

- **Expiration**: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
- **Format**: JWT-style token
- **Usage**: Include in the `Authorization` header

## Security Best Practices

<Checklist>
  <ChecklistItem>
    Store credentials in environment variables, not in your code
  </ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>
    Use HTTPS for all API communications
  </ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>
    Implement token refresh logic to handle expiration
  </ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>
    Never log or expose API credentials
  </ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>
    Rotate credentials regularly
  </ChecklistItem>
</Checklist>
