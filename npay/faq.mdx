# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is NPAY Payment Gateway?

NPAY is a comprehensive payment gateway solution that provides secure, reliable, and easy-to-integrate payment processing capabilities for your applications. It supports multiple currencies and payment methods, allowing you to accept payments from customers worldwide.

### How do I get started with NPAY API?

To get started with the NPAY API:

1. **Register** for a merchant account
2. **Obtain** your API credentials (Client ID and Secret Key)
3. **Choose** your integration method (PHP, cURL, etc.)
4. **Test** in sandbox environment
5. **Deploy** to production

### What currencies are supported?

NPAY supports various international currencies including USD, EUR, GBP, CAD, AUD, JPY, and many more. For a complete list of supported currencies, contact our support team.

### Is there a sandbox environment for testing?

Yes! NPAY provides a sandbox environment for testing your integration. Use the sandbox base URL: `https://your-domain.com/pay/sandbox/api/v1` for all testing purposes.

## Authentication & Security

### How do I get my API credentials?

1. Log in to your NPAY merchant dashboard
2. Navigate to the **API** section
3. Generate your **Client ID** and **Secret Key**
4. Keep these credentials secure and confidential

### How long do access tokens last?

Access tokens expire after **600 seconds (10 minutes)**. Implement token refresh logic in your application to handle expiration automatically.

### Is the API secure?

Yes, the NPAY API uses:
- **HTTPS** for all communications
- **OAuth2-style** authentication
- **JWT tokens** for access control
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse

### Can I use HTTP instead of HTTPS?

No. All API communications must use HTTPS for security reasons. HTTP requests will be rejected.

## Payment Processing

### How do I create a payment?

Use the `/payment/create` endpoint with the following parameters:
- `amount` - Payment amount (decimal, 2 decimal places)
- `currency` - Currency code (uppercase, Alpha-3)
- `return_url` - Success redirect URL
- `cancel_url` - Cancel redirect URL (optional)
- `custom` - Custom transaction ID (optional)

### How do I check payment status?

Use the `/payment/status/{token}` endpoint with the payment token returned from the create payment response.

### What happens after a customer completes payment?

After payment completion:
1. Customer is redirected to your `return_url`
2. You can check payment status using the payment token
3. Process the payment result in your application

### Can I process refunds?

Refund functionality is available through our merchant dashboard or by contacting support. API endpoints for refunds may be available in future updates.

## Technical Questions

### What HTTP methods are supported?

The NPAY API supports:
- **POST** - Create resources (tokens, payments)
- **GET** - Retrieve resources (payment status)

### What response formats are supported?

All API responses are in **JSON** format with a consistent structure.

### Is there rate limiting?

Yes, the API has rate limiting:
- **100 requests per minute** per API key
- Rate limit headers are included in responses
- `Retry-After` header indicates when to retry

### What are the common error codes?

Common error codes include:
- **200** - Success
- **400** - Bad Request
- **401** - Unauthorized
- **403** - Forbidden
- **404** - Not Found
- **422** - Unprocessable Entity
- **500** - Internal Server Error

### How do I handle errors?

Implement proper error handling by:
1. Checking HTTP status codes
2. Parsing error messages from responses
3. Implementing retry logic for transient errors
4. Providing user-friendly error messages

## Integration Questions

### Do you provide SDKs?

Currently, we provide code examples in PHP and cURL. SDKs for other languages may be available in the future.

### Can I integrate with mobile apps?

Yes! The NPAY API can be integrated with mobile applications using standard HTTP libraries available in most mobile development frameworks.

### Do you support webhooks?

Webhook support is available. Contact our support team for webhook configuration and documentation.

### How do I test my integration?

1. Use the **sandbox environment** for testing
2. Test all error scenarios
3. Verify payment flows end-to-end
4. Test with different currencies and amounts

## Troubleshooting

### I'm getting "Invalid credentials" error

This usually means:
- Your Client ID or Secret Key is incorrect
- You're using the wrong environment (sandbox vs production)
- Your credentials have been regenerated

### I'm getting "Invalid token" error

This means:
- Your access token has expired (tokens last 10 minutes)
- The token format is incorrect
- You need to get a new access token

### Payment creation is failing

Check:
- All required parameters are provided
- Amount is properly formatted (2 decimal places)
- Currency code is uppercase and valid
