# Base URL

The NPAY Payment Gateway API provides different base URLs for different environments. Choose the appropriate URL based on your integration needs.

## API Endpoints

### Production Environment

Use this URL for live transactions with real money:

```
https://your-domain.com/pay/api/v1
```

### Sandbox Environment

Use this URL for testing and development:

```
https://your-domain.com/pay/sandbox/api/v1
```

<Warning>
  Always test your integration thoroughly in the sandbox environment before switching to production.
