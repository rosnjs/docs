# Prerequisites

Before you begin integrating the NPAY Payment Gateway API, make sure you have the following:

## Required Items

<Checklist>
  <ChecklistItem>
    **An active NPAY merchant account**
    
    You need a registered merchant account to access the API. If you don't have one, you can [register here](/merchant/register).
  </ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>
    **Basic knowledge of API integration and web development**
    
    Familiarity with REST APIs, HTTP methods, and web development concepts (PHP & Laravel recommended).
  </ChecklistItem>
  <ChecklistItem>
    **A secure and accessible web server**
    
    Your server should be able to handle API requests and responses securely.
  </ChecklistItem>
</Checklist>

## Development Environment

### Recommended Setup

- **PHP 7.4+** or **Laravel 8+**
- **HTTPS-enabled server** for secure API communication
- **cURL** or **Guzzle HTTP** for making API requests
- **JSON** support for handling API responses

### Optional Tools

- **Postman** or similar API testing tools
- **Git** for version control
- **Composer** for PHP dependency management

## Security Requirements

<Warning>
  Always use HTTPS for all API communications. Never send sensitive data over unencrypted connections.
</Warning>

- Use secure, encrypted connections (HTTPS)
- Store API credentials securely
- Implement proper error handling
- Validate all user inputs

## Getting Your API Credentials

Once you have a merchant account, you can obtain your API credentials:

1. Log in to your NPAY merchant dashboard
2. Navigate to the **API** section
3. Generate your **Client ID** and **Secret Key**
4. Keep these credentials secure and confidential

<Note>
  Your API credentials are sensitive information. Never share them publicly or commit them to version control.
</Note>
